models predominantly use static scoring systems, which prove inadequate due to their failure to adapt to the dynamic
nature of social networks. This lack of adaptability often results in delayed detection of misinformation. (II) Temporal Oversights: Current approaches typically do not account for temporal changes in the information context or the continuous influx of new data, leading to suboptimal detection and grading accuracy. (III) Immediate Classification: It may not always be possible or accurate, particularly in the face of
uncertain or incomplete information. (IV) Scalability Concerns: The enormous scale of the data on social media and the high user activity levels pose significant computational efficiency and scalability challenges to existing methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mobility data analytics</title><link>https://shreghosh.github.io/project/external-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shreghosh.github.io/project/external-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>Both analyzing mobility traces and understanding a user’s movement semantics from mobile sensor data are challenging issues in ubiquitous computing systems. With the pervasiveness of sensor technologies, wireless networks and GPS-equipped devices, a huge volume of location information is being accumulated. Several techniques have been proposed to analyze the mobility traces and extract informative knowledge for varied location-aware applications. However, all of these applications necessitate an effective mobility-analysis framework to capture the movement behavior of individuals in minimum delay. This project aims to develop a cloud-based mobility analytics framework to model peoples’ mobility behaviour in varied granular scale and extract usable knowledge to provision location-aware services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Night-time light data analytics</title><link>https://shreghosh.github.io/project/ntl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shreghosh.github.io/project/ntl/</guid><description>&lt;p>Night-time light (NTL) data has emerged as a valuable source of information for analyzing human activity patterns from the sky. NTL helps in understanding urbanization patterns, economic development, impact of disasters and finding hotspots of excessive night-light utilization.
%The availability of high-resolution satellite imagery has enabled the study of NTL data at an unprecedented scale. However, the volume, complexity, and temporal dynamics of this data present challenges for visualization and analytics. To address these challenges, we introduce NightVIEW, an interactive tool for NTL data visualization and analytics that offers a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for researchers and stakeholders to explore and analyze NTL data. The tool is powered by an efficient system architecture to easily export and analyse huge volumes of spatial data (NTL) and computing components including image segmentation, clustering and change pattern detection to find urban development and sprawl patterns. The system is also capable to identify the temporal trends of NTL at different geographical region and captures the semantics of cities by exploring artificial light use at night. Specifically, NightVIEW helps in answering questions such as: What demographic factors influence NTL data and to what extent? Can we detect the boundaries of a city, urban area, or metropolitan area? How does it differ from the political boundaries and why? Where are the differences with demographic data unusual? We envision our tool, NightVIEW, as a companion for researchers in developing AI-based analytics as well as a guide for government stakeholders who can leverage the computing capacity of our modules to design policies and regulations related to NTL usage.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
