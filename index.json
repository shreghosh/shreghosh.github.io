However, the volume, complexity, and temporal dynamics of this data present challenges for visualization and analytics. To address these challenges, we introduce NightVIEW, an interactive tool for NTL data visualization and analytics that offers a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for researchers and stakeholders to explore and analyze NTL data. The tool is powered by an efficient system architecture to easily export and analyse huge volumes of spatial data (NTL) and computing components including image segmentation, clustering and change pattern detection to find urban development and sprawl patterns. The system is also capable to identify the temporal trends of NTL at different geographical region and captures the semantics of cities by exploring artificial light use at night. Specifically, NightVIEW helps in answering questions such as: What demographic factors influence NTL data and to what extent? Can we detect the boundaries of a city, urban area, or metropolitan area? How does it differ from the political boundaries and why? Where are the differences with demographic data unusual? We envision our tool, NightVIEW, as a companion for researchers in developing AI-based analytics as well as a guide for government stakeholders who can leverage the computing capacity of our modules to design policies and regulations related to NTL usage.\n","date":1651017600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651017600,"objectID":"327444af7dab4f20998d2466132be590","permalink":"https://shreghosh.github.io/project/ntl/","publishdate":"2022-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ntl/","section":"project","summary":"Night-time light (NTL) data has emerged as a valuable source of information for analyzing human activity patterns from the sky.

It leverages the mobility patterns of IoT and edge devices in a 2-D space, using GPS logs and contextual data to predict their real-time locations through machine learning. The framework's features include a hierarchical IoT-Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture for improved real-time QoS, mobility-based agent location prediction, and effective handling of delay and power consumption, resulting in around 93\\% prediction accuracy and 23–26% delay reduction and 37–41\\% power reduction compared to existing systems.","tags":["Cloud Fog IoST"],"title":"Mobi-iost: mobility-aware cloud-fog-edge-iot collaborative framework for time-critical applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shreya Ghosh"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!
