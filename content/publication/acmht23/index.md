abstract: "Our model incorporates a causal user attribute inference model to label users as potential misinformation propagators or believers. Designed for early detection, the model includes two auxiliary tasks: forecasting the scope of misinformation dissemination and clustering similar nodes (users) based on their attributes outperforming the current state-of-the-art benchmarks."
