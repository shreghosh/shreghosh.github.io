With the pervasiveness of sensor technologies, wireless networks and GPS-equipped devices, a huge volume of location information is being accumulated. Several techniques have been proposed to analyze the mobility traces and extract informative knowledge for varied location-aware applications. However, all of these applications necessitate an effective mobility-analysis framework to capture the movement behavior of individuals in minimum delay. This project aims to develop a cloud-based mobility analytics framework to model peoples’ mobility behaviour in varied granular scale and extract usable knowledge to provision location-aware services.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
